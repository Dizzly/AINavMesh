WASD to move your character or click where you want him. Space bar to switch betwene view modes: the first shows all nodes and connections. Second shows calculated normals for outer edges. All three show AI path but thrid allows you to see it clearer.

Stay on the nav mesh to have the AI follow you, the red ball will path find to you while the blue balls will avoid the red. 

The pathfinding should work on any non overlapping, trinagulated 2D mesh.
